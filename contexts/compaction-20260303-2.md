# Session Compaction Summary

## User Intent

- Fix spatial/positional questions that felt "wrong" due to ambiguous grid placement
- Replace nonsensical text entity labels with recognizable icons to reduce cognitive friction
- Polish premise/conclusion layout for better fit on small screens

## Contextual Work Summary

### Spatial Question Fix — Unit-Step Walk Model

The core bug: the 3×3 grid placed entities at varying distances (1 or 2 steps), so "northeast" could mean different things — making the same set of normalized clues compatible with multiple different layouts, and thus multiple valid conclusions. The fix: replace `placeEntitiesRandomly` with `placeEntitiesAsWalk`, which builds entity positions via a unit-step walk in any of 8 directions. Each consecutive pair is always exactly 1 step apart. This makes every direction clue unambiguous and unique without needing Prolog verification.

### Prolog Verifier Removed for Spatial

With the walk model, spatial verification is pure arithmetic: reconstruct positions from premise vectors, check that `sign(Δx), sign(Δy)` matches the claimed conclusion direction. Replaced `verifySpatialQuestion` with a pure JS implementation. Removed all Prolog infrastructure (`initProlog`, `getRulesProgram`, the session, the `initialized` guard, spatial helper methods). `verifyQuestion` no longer takes a `spatialGrid` parameter.

### Icon Entities

Replaced nonsensical 5-letter words with phosphor icons. Added `iconName` field to `Entity`. `EntityFactory` now supports `useIcons: true`, picking unique icons from a curated 82-icon pool (`ICON_POOL` in EntityFactory). `Renderer.renderEntity()` helper emits `<i class="ph-light ph-{name} entity-icon">` for icon entities, falling back to `<span class="entity">` for text. Icon mode active in `main.js`. Word generation code kept intact.

### Icon Curation Tool

Created `icon-preview.html` — a standalone browser page listing all 82 candidate icons in a grid. Click to remove, click again to restore, "Copy final list" outputs the JS array. Kept as a useful reference tool.

### Layout Fixes

Several CSS/HTML changes to prevent overflow on small screens:
- Entity pills reduced (`0.82rem`, `3px 8px` padding)
- Body padding reduced to `8px` on mobile; premises-container horizontal padding trimmed
- Conclusion: `max-width` relaxed, double-padding removed, font size reduced to `1rem`
- `conclusion-tail` wrapper groups last entity + `?` so they never orphan-wrap separately

### `testSpatial` Console Helper

Added `window.tanmateix.testSpatial(entities=3)` to force a spatial question, parallel to the existing `testSyllogistic`.

### Version Bump

`manifest.json` bumped from `0.8.0` → `0.9.0`.

## Files Touched

### Core Logic
- **`utils/SpatialGrid.js`**: Replaced 3×3 bounded grid with `placeEntitiesAsWalk` (unit-step, 8 directions, no reversal). `placeEntitiesRandomly` kept for legacy use. `toString()` now renders from actual positions dynamically.
- **`verification/QuestionVerifier.js`**: Removed all Prolog code. `verifySpatialQuestion` now pure JS. `verifyQuestion` signature simplified (no `spatialGrid` param).
- **`generators/PathBasedQuestionGenerator.js`**: Calls `placeEntitiesAsWalk`; removed `spatialGrid` extraction and passing to verifier. Added `testSpatial` helper in `window.tanmateix`.
- **`core/Entity.js`**: Added optional `iconName` field; serialises/deserialises cleanly.
- **`utils/EntityFactory.js`**: Added `useIcons` mode and `ICON_POOL` constant (82 icons). Word generation retained.

### Rendering
- **`render/Renderer.js`**: Added `renderEntity()` helper. `renderPremise` and `renderConclusion` use it. `conclusion-tail` wrapper introduced to keep last entity + `?` together.
- **`render/logic.css`**: Added `.entity-icon` (1.9rem, 0.4px stroke). Reduced entity pill size. Mobile padding fixes for body/premises/conclusion.

### Tools & Config
- **`icon-preview.html`**: New standalone icon curation page (kept permanently).
- **`main.js`**: Switched to `useIcons: true`. Added `testSpatial` console helper.
- **`manifest.json`**: Version `0.9.0`.
