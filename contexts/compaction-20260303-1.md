# Session Compaction Summary

## User Intent

- Review the spatial/positional question generator for bugs observed in practice
- Understand why spatial questions felt "slightly off" or directly wrong
- Evaluate whether the 3×3 grid restriction should be removed

## Contextual Work Summary

### Code Review — Surface Bugs Found and Fixed

Two bugs were found and fixed in `generateSpatialGraphQuestion` (test-only helper, not the main game):
- Conclusion text lookup used the raw (unnormalized) grid vector as the vocab key → fell back to "relates to" for most entity pairs
- Invalid conclusion text lookup had the same raw-key issue
- Fix: normalize the conclusion vector before vocab lookup; store normalized vector in the relation

Also fixed: the 25% indeterminate-question bypass in `generateMultiPathQuestion` did not check `forceRelationType`, so `testSyllogistic` would silently produce linear indeterminate questions 1-in-4 times. Fixed by gating the bypass on `!forceRelationType`.

### Main Game Spatial Logic — Reviewed, No Clear Bug Found

The path-based spatial pipeline (`generateMultiPathQuestion` → `createPath` → `Path.generateRelations` → `getInferredRelation`) was reviewed thoroughly. The vector arithmetic is mathematically sound: the sum of raw edge vectors always equals exactly `C − A`, so normalization always gives the correct direction. The Prolog verifier also derives conclusions from actual grid positions independently. No logical contradiction was found.

### A Hypothesis Worth Investigating Next Session

The user reported questions feeling "slightly off" or "directly wrong." One candidate explanation — not yet confirmed — is that the 3×3 grid places consecutive entities at varying distances (1 or 2 grid steps apart), which may cause:

- The displayed normalized clue ("south of B") to be ambiguous: it could mean 1 step or 2 steps south
- On a 3×3 grid, the same pair of normalized premises can sometimes yield different valid conclusions depending on which specific positions were picked
- With longer paths, the boundary is hit frequently and distance-2 edges become more common

This is a hypothesis. It should be verified empirically (e.g. by logging and playing through several spatial questions) before committing to a fix.

### One Direction That Was Proposed (Not Agreed Upon)

One approach discussed: replace the concrete 3×3 grid with a walk-based model where each edge is always exactly one unit step in a random direction. This would make the inference uniquely determinable from the normalized clues alone. The user stopped the session before this was agreed upon or implemented.

## Files Touched

### Core Logic

- **`generators/PathBasedQuestionGenerator.js`**: Fixed conclusion vector normalization in `generateSpatialGraphQuestion`; fixed `forceRelationType` not suppressing the indeterminate bypass

### Pending (Next Session)

- Investigate the reported spatial "wrongness" empirically before assuming a fix
- Reconsider the 3×3 grid vs. walk-based approach with fresh eyes
